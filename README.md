# Programming-for-Data-Science-CA1
School CA1 project for elective, Python Programming for Data Science.

This is a data analysis presentation for at least 3 datasets belonging to the National Environment Agency (NEA) based on a few requirements.

It includes:
- questions to be answered to gain deeper insights into the chosen datasets such that an interesting data analysis can be produced.
- for each dataset, write Python code that uses the Numpy package to extract useful statistical or summary information about the data and Matplotlib package to produce useful data visualizations that explain the data
- for each dataset, explain the nature of that dataset (i.e., what is in that dataset) or any peculiarities about it to highlight and explain the process went through to analyze that dataset.
- for each dataset, describe the insights gained from analyzing the data and any conclusions or recommendations to make from the analysis.
- total of 5 graphs are required to be plotted (line chart, histogram, scatterplot, bar chart, and pie chart)
